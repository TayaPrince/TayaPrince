## :vulcan_salute: Hi there, I am [TayaPrince](https://www.linkedin.com/in/taya-prince-a2bb67169/) :monocle_face: ##

##### What I do ##### 

I believe in data driven decision making, science, and the potential of technology. This is why I strive to combine my attention to detail, passion for data, 
and ability to learn quickly to help my research group perfect their data collection, cleaning, storage, and analysis by using the tools that are available 
to us through technology. This will help us to drive forward the research we are conducting, so that treatment of psychiatric patients can be improved. 

##### What I am learning #####
I am currently completing a professional certificate in Data Analytics and my Master of Science in Economics. A professional certificate in Data Science will be my next project.
